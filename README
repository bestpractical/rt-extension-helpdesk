WHAT THIS EXTENSION DOES
    This extension adds some useful help desk configurations to get started.

    It create a new queue, the "Support Queue" for tracking all of the
    incoming help desk requests. On this queue some sensible default rights
    are set. The first group granted rights is the "Everyone" group. This is
    an "internal" group to RT, and as the name implies it encompasses every
    user in RT.

    With a typical support desk setup, these rights are exactly whats
    needed. Anyone is able to write into our support address with a help
    desk question, and they can always reply and follow-up on that request.

    It is also desirable to have a group to track and elevate the rights of
    our support representatives. The "Support Group" is created for just
    this purpose.

    Here additional rights are granted to the support representatives,
    mainly the rights center around being able to own and edit tickets in
    the support queue.

    Since we have a specific queue for help desk request it also makes a lot
    of sense to make a specific workflow for these request. In RT a ticket
    workflow is known as the Lifecycle
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/customizing/lifecycles.html>.

    The support lifecycle here uses custom statuses such as "waiting for
    customer" and "waiting for support" for which we can enable some handy
    automation around.

    The automation applied to the support queue is designed to allow support
    reps to more easily keep track of support request that they should be
    working on. There are two new "Scrips" ( A scrip is the internal
    automation for RT ) that are added "On Requestor Correspond Update
    Status To "waiting for support"" and "On Non-Requestor Correspond Update
    Status To "waiting for customer"". These scrips handle switching the
    status of a support ticket based on who last updated the ticket, the
    customer or the support rep.

    This allows for the support rep to know based on the status of a ticket,
    whether the customer is waiting to hear back from them or they are
    waiting to hear back from the customer.

CONFIGURATION
    Support Queue
        This extension creates a new queue named "Support". This queue is
        where incoming support request should be created.

    Support Group
        This group is created by the extension and granted rights to perform
        typical support opperations on tickets in the support group. You
        should add any support representative users to this group.

    On Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for support"
        Automation to switch ticket status to "waiting for support" when a
        requestor replies to a ticket, the requestor is typically the
        customer who is asking for support.

    On Non-Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for customer"
        Automation to switch ticket status to "waiting for customer" when a
        user who is not a requestor on the ticket replies on the ticket.
        This usually means the support representative in charge of the
        ticket sent an email to the customer and is waiting for some
        feedback.
