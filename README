CONFIGURATION
    Support Queue
        This extension creates a new queue named "Support". This queue is
        where incoming support request should be created.

    Support Group
        This group is created by the extension and granted rights to perform
        typical support opperations on tickets in the support group. You
        should add any support representative users to this group.

    On Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for support"
        Automation to switch ticket status to "waiting for support" when a
        requestor replies to a ticket, the requestor is typically the
        customer who is asking for support.

    On Non-Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for customer"
        Automation to switch ticket status to "waiting for customer" when a
        user who is not a requestor on the ticket replies on the ticket.
        This usually means the support representative in charge of the
        ticket sent an email to the customer and is waiting for some
        feedback.
