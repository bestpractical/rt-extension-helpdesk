DESCRIPTION
    One common use for Request Tracker (RT) is tracking user issues,
    typically related to IT services. The "help desk" is often a department,
    either a designated help desk with many agents for large organizations,
    or sometimes only a one or two people who handle all IT services for a
    smaller organization.

    RT is used to track incoming user requests so they don't get lost and
    can be assigned to individual people to handle. It's also useful for
    gathering general reporting on the volume of user IT requests and what
    types of issues seem to generate the most issues.

    This extension provides an initialdata
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/initialdata.html/> file to
    configure a queue with some sensible default rights configuration for a
    typical help desk. Once installed, you can then edit the configuration
    to best suit your needs.

  Support Queue
    It creates a new queue called Support for tracking all of the incoming
    help desk requests. You can change the name to anything you like after
    installing. In a typical configuration, you will also want to assign an
    RT email address, like support@example.com or helpdesk@example.com to
    create tickets in this queue.

  Rights
    Some typical initial rights are set on the Support queue. The system
    group "Everyone" gets a default set of rights to allow end users to
    create tickets. Everyone is system group provided with RT, and as the
    name implies it encompasses every user in RT.

    These rights are usually the minimum needed for a typical support desk.
    Anyone is able to write into our support address with a help desk
    question, and they can reply and follow-up on that request if we send
    them some questions.

    The extension also grants "ShowTicket" to the Requestor role. If your
    end users have access to RT's self service interface, this allows them
    to see only tickets where they are the Requestor, which should be the
    tickets they opened.

    Our internal support representatives will need many more rights to work
    on tickets. To make it easy to add and remove access for staff users,
    this extension creates a "Support Group". Rights are granted to the
    group, so membership in the group is all a user needs to get those
    rights.

  Support Lifecycle
    RT allows you to create and configure custom workflows for each queue in
    the system. In RT a ticket workflow is known as a Lifecycle
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/customizing/lifecycles.html>.
    This extension provies a custom lifecycle called "support" that defines
    the various statuses a ticket can be in.

    The custom statuses "waiting for customer" and "waiting for support"
    triggers some automation around replying to support requests.

    The automation applied to the support queue is designed to allow support
    staff to more easily keep track of support requests that need attention.
    There are two new Scrips that do the following:

    On Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for support"
        Updates the ticket status to "waiting for support" when a requestor
        replies to a ticket. The requestor is typically the end user who is
        asking for support.

    On Non-Requestor Correspond Update Status To "waiting for customer"
        Updates the ticket status to "waiting for customer" when a user who
        is not a requestor on the ticket replies on the ticket. This usually
        means the support representative in charge of the ticket sent an
        email to the customer and is waiting for some feedback.
